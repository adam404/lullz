# Lullz - Background Sound Generator

Lullz is a scientifically-informed background sound generator app designed to help users create customized audio environments for relaxation, focus, and sleep.

## Features

### Core Sound Generation

- **Multiple Noise Types**: Choose between white, pink, brown, blue, violet, grey, and green noise, each with distinct frequency characteristics
- **Binaural Beats**: Generate binaural beats with customizable frequencies for different cognitive states
- **Mixed Environments**: Combine multiple sound layers for rich, customized soundscapes
- **High-Quality Audio**: Clean, consistent sound generation optimized for headphone use
- **Background Audio**: Continues playing when app is in the background

### Advanced Audio Controls

- **Balance Adjustment**: Fine-tune the left/right balance for personalized spatial sound
- **Independent Ear Delay**: Apply separate delay settings to each ear for unique psychoacoustic effects
- **Volume Control**: Precise volume adjustment with smooth transitions
- **Floating Volume Control**: Access volume controls from anywhere in the app

### User Experience

- **Save Custom Profiles**: Create, name, and save your favorite sound configurations
- **Profile Management**: Browse, edit, and delete saved profiles
- **Sleep Timer**: Set customizable timers to automatically stop playback
- **Visualizers**: Visual representations of the active sounds for a multisensory experience
- **Breathing Exercises**: Guided breathing patterns with visual and audio cues
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, accessible design with light and dark mode support
- **Accessibility**: Full VoiceOver support and dynamic text sizing

### Scientific Information

- **Educational Content**: Learn about the science behind different noise types
- **Sound Science Section**: Detailed explanations of various noise characteristics
- **Research References**: Citations to scientific studies on sound and its effects

### Legal Compliance

- **Clear Disclaimers**: Transparent about non-medical nature of the application
- **Privacy Policy**: Comprehensive information about data usage and privacy
- **Terms of Service**: Clear user agreement documentation

## Scientific Background

Lullz is built on acoustic research showing how different noise profiles can affect concentration, relaxation, and sleep quality. The app features:

- **White Noise**: Equal power across all frequencies, helpful for masking environmental sounds
- **Pink Noise**: Power decreases as frequency increases (1/f spectrum), often described as more natural sounding
- **Brown Noise**: Power decreases more rapidly at higher frequencies (1/f² spectrum), creating a deeper, richer sound
- **Blue Noise**: Power increases with frequency (f¹ spectrum), emphasizing higher frequencies for focus and alertness
- **Violet Noise**: Power increases more steeply with frequency (f² spectrum), used in some tinnitus treatments
- **Grey Noise**: Psychoacoustically engineered noise that sounds equally loud at all frequencies to human ears
- **Green Noise**: Midrange-focused noise, similar to the ambient sounds of nature
- **Binaural Beats**: Two slightly different frequencies create a "beat" effect when heard through separate ears, potentially influencing brainwave states

## Architecture

Lullz follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, providing a clean separation of concerns and improved maintainability. The architecture consists of:

- **Models**: Core data structures and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views responsible for UI rendering
- **ViewModels**: Intermediate layer handling presentation logic and state management

For more detailed information about the app's architecture, please refer to our documentation:

- [Implementation Status](docs/implementation-status.md) - Details about implementation specifics
- [Migration Plan](docs/migration-plan.md) - Plan for migrating components to MVVM
