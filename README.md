## Scientific Background

Lullz is built on acoustic research showing how different noise profiles can affect concentration, relaxation, and sleep quality. The app features:

- **White Noise**: Equal power across all frequencies, helpful for masking environmental sounds
- **Pink Noise**: Power decreases as frequency increases, often described as more "natural" sounding
- **Brown Noise**: Power decreases more rapidly at higher frequencies, creating a deeper, richer sound
