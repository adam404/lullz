# Resources Directory

This directory contains audio resources needed by the app.

## Required Audio Files for Breathing Exercise

The following WAV files need to be added to this directory:

1. `inhale.wav` - A soft sound played during the inhale phase of breathing exercises
2. `exhale.wav` - A gentle sound played during the exhale phase of breathing exercises
3. `hold.wav` - A subtle tone played during breath holding phases

You need to manually add these files to your Xcode project.

For testing, you can generate simple tones with different pitches:

- Higher pitch for inhale
- Medium pitch for hold
- Lower pitch for exhale

## Adding to Xcode Project

After placing these files in this directory, be sure to:

1. Add them to your Xcode project
2. Make sure they're included in your app's target
3. Confirm "Copy items if needed" is checked when adding them
